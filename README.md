1) Uninstall the app from the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.safetycore.
2) Download the APK from this repository.
3) Install it.

Enjoy!

When Google tries to replace the APK with the updated SafetyCore app, it will fail due to a signature mismatch.

Changelog :

- v2: Increased the version number to 2000000000, causing the Play Store update to become unavailable.

- v3: Removed unnecessary code, reducing the app size from 5.4 MB to 1.5 MB.
