# Instructions
1) Uninstall the app from the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.safetycore.
2) Download the APK from this repository.
3) Install it.

Enjoy!

If Google tries to replace the APK with the updated SafetyCore app, it will fail due to a signature mismatch.
